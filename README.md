# 👋 Hi, I'm nzhooch

## 💻 About Me
With over 35 years in IT (and it sure feels like more...), I’m fluent in everything from classic DOS and Windows 3.1, right through to Windows 11. I’m also pretty handy with Linux scripting—because who doesn’t love a challenge from the command line?

## 🛠️ Skills
- DOS (yes, still relevant sometimes!)
- Windows (3.1 → 11)
- Linux scripting (“fluent-ish,” but always learning)
- General troubleshooting wizardry

## 🐾 Interests
- Greyhounds (ask me about their stride cycles!)
- Linux (open source is the way)

> 💡 **Fun fact:**  
> A full stride cycle for a greyhound at top speed takes about 0.35 seconds, and the airborne phases (combined) make up roughly 75% of that time.

## 🌱 Currently
- Chasing down new tech
- Enjoying the journey, one script at a time
